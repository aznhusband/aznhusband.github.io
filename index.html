    <h1>Current Version: 2.2.0</h1>

    <h2>Repository addon</h2>

    <p>Note: You'll have to update the repository.  We now use ResolveURL.<p>

    <p>Instructions for adding this repo:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Go to the Kodi file manager.</li>
      <li>Click on "Add source"</li>
      <li>The path for the source is <b>https://aznhusband.github.io/repo</b>  Give it the name "aznhusband-repo".</li>
      <li>Go to "Addons"</li>
      <li>In Addons, install an addon from zip.  When it asks for the location, select "aznhusband-repo", and install
          <a href="https://aznhusband.github.io/repo/repository.aznhusband-kodi-repo-1.1.1.zip">repository.aznhusband-kodi-repo-1.1.1.zip</a>
      </li>
      <li>Go back to Addons install, but this time, select "Install from repository"</li>
      <li>Select the "aznhusband-kodi-repo"</li>
      <li>Go into the "Video add-ons" section in the repo, and you'll find the Icdrama plugin.</li>
    </ul>

    For those of you updating, remember that you need to force a <a href="https://koditips.com/force-check-for-updates-kodi-addons/">check for updates</a>
    in order to get Kodi to bring in the ResolveURL depencency.

    <h2>ResolveURL</h2>

    <p>Icdrama now uses the ResolveURL resolver.  Installing from the repo
       above should bring in the latest ResolveURL.<p>

    <h2>Manually downloading the zip files</h2>

    <p>You can manually download the zip files from 
       <a
           href="https://aznhusband.github.io/plugin.video.icdrama/">plugin.video.icdrama</a>,
       but if you do this, you won't automatically bring in the ResolveURL
       dependency.</p>
